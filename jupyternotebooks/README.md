### Jupyter Notebooks prediction analysis 
In the IBM Cloud Pak for Data - IBM Watson Studio, you can create Python, Scala, and R notebooks to analyze your data.Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive computational environment for developing Python based Data Science applications. Jupyter notebooks can illustrate the analysis process step by step by arranging the stuff like code, images, text, output etc. in a step by step manner. We are using Watson Studio Jupyter Notebook for predicting which NC counties will be most at risk from a Hurricane or Tropical Storm.
